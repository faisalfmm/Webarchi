By the early 1970s, he had already made his name in the British architectural industry. Known for his clean lines, his style is often praised for its sleek, modern nature, and has earned the tag of \u201cHigh Tech\u201d architecture. He works with glass and steel significantly, and some of his famous buildings include The Gherkin, the Apple Park, and Crystal Island. He has earned the reputation of being the \u201cFather of High Tech Architecture\u201d, but Foster is also an advocate of something he calls the \u201cresponsibility framework\u201d. This framework outlines his design philosophy: sustainable architecture with a focus on visitor experience.
